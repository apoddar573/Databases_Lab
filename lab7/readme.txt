The assignment uses the python cassandra-driver.

Cassandra version 3.11.2 has been used to accomplish this task.

The first part of my code first creates the keyspace and tables and enters the data in it. The workshop_dataset1 folder needs to be in the same directory as lab1.py.

The second part has a while loop and keeps asking us for queries. It first takes input whether we want a query for question3 or question9. Then, it evaluates the query based on further input. You can quit by giving 1 as input.

The output for ques3 is in ques3.csv and for ques9 is ques9.csv
